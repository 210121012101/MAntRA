This repository contains code for discovering equations, generating random force, and evaluating reliability for a building's structural response. Here are some important notes to keep in mind:

1) Each equation discovery code is independent. "Drift 1" refers to the code for the first floor.
2) To run the reliability code, you need the prediction data generated by the actual/final prediction file.
3) A forcing pickle file is used to generate random force.
4) The VB algorithm RVM is used for initialization. You must save the Sparsebayes package (to run RVM) in the folder where the codes are being run.
5) The Sparsebayes folder is attached in the repository.
6 The order for running the codes is as follows:
    1) Drift & Diffusion file for equation discovery
    2) Forcing pickle file to generate random force
    3) Initial & Final prediction file to generate a larger window for reliability
    4) Reliability file to find the probability of failure.
